# ContactsApp

ContactsApp is a straightforward iOS application designed for managing your contacts efficiently. The app allows you to view a list of contacts, search through them, add new contacts, and view detailed information about each contact.

## Features

### Contacts List
The main screen of the app displays a list of contacts using a table view. The contacts are listed in alphabetical order by their names. A search bar is provided at the top to enable quick filtering of contacts based on the user's search queries.

### Adding a Contact
To add a new contact, simply tap the "+" button located at the top-right corner of the Contacts List screen. This will take you to the "Add Contact" page.

### Adding Photo (Optional)
On the "Add Contact" page, you have the option to select a photo for the contact. Tapping the "Add Photo" button allows you to pick a photo from your device's gallery.

### Contact Information
When adding a new contact, you are required to provide the contact's first name and phone number. The last name field is optional. Once you have entered the necessary information, tap the "Done" button to save the contact.

### Saving and Canceling
Upon tapping the "Done" button, the contact's information is saved using Core Data, a local database system. The app then returns to the Contacts List screen, and the newly added contact appears in the list.

However, if you decide not to save the contact, you can tap the "Cancel" button instead of "Done". This will discard any changes and take you back to the Contacts List screen without creating a new contact entry.

### Viewing Contact Details
From the Contacts List screen, tapping on any contact in the list will lead you to the Contact Details screen. Here, you can view all the information about the selected contact, including their photo (if added), first name, last name, and phone number.
